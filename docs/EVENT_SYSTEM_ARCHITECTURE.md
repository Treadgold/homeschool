# Event System Architecture Documentation

## 🏗️ System Overview

The LifeLearners event system is designed as a comprehensive, extensible platform for managing educational events, field trips, workshops, and community activities. The architecture supports complex requirements including multi-age groups, supervision tracking, real-time head counts, and sophisticated pricing models.

## 📋 Core Components

### 1. **AI-Powered Event Creation**
- **Natural Language Processing**: Users describe events in plain English
- **Intelligent Extraction**: AI parses details like dates, pricing, age ranges, supervision requirements
- **Real-time Preview**: Split-screen interface shows event building live
- **Fallback Processing**: Works even when AI providers are offline

### 2. **Comprehensive Event Model**
```python
ComprehensiveEvent
├── Basic Info (title, description, type)
├── Scheduling (start/end times, recurrence)
├── Location (physical/virtual venues)
├── Capacity Management (limits, waitlists)
├── Age Groups & Supervision (ratios, requirements)
├── Pricing & Ticketing (multi-tier pricing)
├── Requirements & Policies (health, equipment)
├── Staff & Supervision (assignments, ratios)
├── Media & Marketing (images, videos, tags)
├── Registration Management (forms, approvals)
└── Analytics & Tracking (performance metrics)
```

### 3. **Safety-First Design**
- **Supervision Ratios**: Configurable adult-to-child ratios by age
- **Guardian Requirements**: Automatic enforcement for young children
- **Real-time Head Count**: Live attendance tracking for safety
- **Emergency Procedures**: Built-in evacuation and emergency protocols

```

## 🧩 Extensible Architecture

### Adding New Event Types

```python
class EventType(PyEnum):
    # Existing types...
    NEW_TYPE = "new_type"  # Add new event type

# Update AI classification in ai_tools.py
def classify_event_type(description: str) -> EventType:
    # Add classification logic for new type
    if "new type keyword" in description.lower():
        return EventType.NEW_TYPE
```

### Adding Custom Fields

```python
# In ComprehensiveEvent model
custom_fields = Column(JSON, nullable=True)

# Usage example
event.custom_fields = {
    "outdoor_equipment_needed": ["tent", "sleeping_bag"],
    "certification_required": "first_aid",
    "special_dietary_options": ["vegan", "gluten_free"]
}
```

### Extending Supervision Features

```python
class SupervisionLevel(PyEnum):
    LIFEGUARD_REQUIRED = "lifeguard"      # For water activities
    MEDICAL_STAFF = "medical"             # For high-risk activities
    CERTIFIED_INSTRUCTOR = "certified"    # For specialized skills

# Add to supervision_ratio JSON field
supervision_ratio = {
    "water_activities": {"ratio": 4, "certified_lifeguard": True},
    "high_ropes": {"ratio": 6, "certified_instructor": True}
}
```

## 📱 Real-time Features Implementation

### Head Count System

```python
class EventCheckIn(Base):
    # Real-time tracking fields
    location_within_venue = Column(String(100))  # "Main Hall", "Playground"
    device_check_in = Column(String(50))         # QR scanner ID
    parent_notification_sent = Column(Boolean)    # Auto-notify parents
    emergency_contact_status = Column(String(50)) # Contact verification
    
    @property
    def current_location(self):
        """Get participant's current location within venue"""
        return self.location_within_venue
    
    def notify_emergency_contact(self):
        """Send notification to emergency contact"""
        # Implementation for emergency notifications
        pass
```

### Live Dashboard Integration

```python
class EventDashboard:
    """Real-time event monitoring dashboard"""
    
    def get_live_headcount(self, event_id: int) -> Dict:
        """Get current head count by location and age group"""
        return {
            "total_present": 45,
            "by_age_group": {"5-8": 12, "9-12": 20, "13-15": 13},
            "by_location": {"main_hall": 30, "playground": 15},
            "supervision_status": "adequate",
            "alerts": []
        }
    
    def check_supervision_ratios(self, event_id: int) -> List[Dict]:
        """Monitor supervision ratios in real-time"""
        # Implementation for ratio monitoring
        pass
```

## 🔧 AI Agent Extensions

### Adding New Tools

```python
class EventCreationTools:
    async def check_weather_conditions(self, date: str, location: str) -> Dict:
        """
        NEW TOOL: Check weather for outdoor events
        
        Args:
            date: Event date (YYYY-MM-DD)
            location: Event location
            
        Returns:
            Weather forecast and recommendations
        """
        # Weather API integration
        return {
            "forecast": "Sunny, 22°C",
            "recommendations": ["Perfect for outdoor activities"],
            "backup_plan_needed": False
        }
    
    async def suggest_catering_options(self, 
                                     participant_count: int,
                                     dietary_requirements: List[str],
                                     budget_per_person: float) -> Dict:
        """
        NEW TOOL: AI-powered catering suggestions
        """
        # Implementation for catering recommendations
        pass
```

### Enhanced Natural Language Processing

```python
def _extract_event_info_fallback(self, user_message: str) -> Dict:
    """Enhanced extraction with new patterns"""
    
    # Add new extraction patterns
    dietary_patterns = [
        r"(vegetarian|vegan|gluten.?free|dairy.?free)",
        r"allergies?.*(nuts?|eggs?|shellfish)"
    ]
    
    equipment_patterns = [
        r"bring.*(water.?bottle|sunhat|closed.?shoes)",
        r"we.?provide.*(materials|equipment|lunch)"
    ]
    
    # Implementation continues...
```

## 📊 Analytics and Reporting

### Event Performance Metrics

```python
class EventAnalytics:
    """Comprehensive event analytics system"""
    
    def calculate_engagement_score(self, event_id: int) -> float:
        """Calculate event engagement based on multiple factors"""
        factors = {
            "registration_speed": 0.3,    # How quickly event filled up
            "participant_retention": 0.2,  # No-show rate
            "feedback_scores": 0.3,        # Post-event ratings
            "repeat_attendance": 0.2       # Previous participants returning
        }
        # Implementation...
    
    def generate_safety_report(self, event_id: int) -> Dict:
        """Generate comprehensive safety report"""
        return {
            "supervision_compliance": "100%",
            "incidents": [],
            "evacuation_time": "2:45",
